# ‚ùì About This Project

SCNSolarSystem is an educational project for developers learning how to use [Apple's SceneKit 3D framework](https://developer.apple.com/scenekit/).

This is an inaccurate representation of our solar system, originally made for my kids.

## Conventions

This project uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) for its commit messages.

# üñ• Supported Platforms
